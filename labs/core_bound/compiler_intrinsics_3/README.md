This is a third lab about using [compiler intrinsics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function) to speed up parts of the code, where compilers fail to generate optimal code.

The task of this lab is to find the average position of a series of positions in 3d space.

The idea for this lab was proposed by Jonathan Hallstr√∂m (@JonathanHallstrom).
