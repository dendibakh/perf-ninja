[Matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) is an important building block for many numerical algorithms. In this lab assignment, we compute the integer power of a given real square matrix.
The binary representation of the power significantly reduces the number of matrix operations. Still, the code has a major performance flaw. Your job is to find it out.
